A plugin that adds the Wavesurfer Audio Player Web Component to WordPress

== Description ==
This is a single block plugin that adds an audio player web component block to the Gutenberg editor.
This audio player renders the waveform of the audio when loaded and allows the user to move the playhead, play, and pause audio.
The block also shows the total duration of the audio and the current elapsed play time.
The current version of the block contains only 2 themes (dark and light), but may be expanded in the future.
Audio for the player is stored in WordPress as media.
