A plugin that adds the Wavesurfer Audio Player Web Component to WordPress

== Description ==

This is a single block plugin that adds an audio player web component block to the Gutenberg editor.<br />
This audio player renders the waveform of the audio when loaded and allows the user to move the playhead, play, and pause audio.<br />
The block also shows the total duration of the audio and the current elapsed play time.<br />
The current version of the block contains only 2 themes (dark and light), but may be expanded in the future. <br />
Audio for the player is stored in WordPress as media.
